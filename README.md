### Hi there, I`m Dmitry ðŸ‘‹  

Glad to see you here!  
  
I am a junior frontend developer. I love programming, traveling and workout.  
  
As a frontender, i enjoy creating beautiful and functional websites.  
In the future i plan to move to the full-stack developer.
  
In this <a href="https://portfolio.students.nomoreparties.space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">portfolio</a> you can see my work.  
I hid the code of some of them, because i am a senior student on Yandex.Practicum and help novice developers learn web-development. As a senior student i can't let my students cheat. ))
